:100: ***ACCOUNTABILITY GUIDELINES*** :trophy:

Welcome to our #accountability section! Here I have designed an accountability program to help you develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms, which will help you develop control over your mind.

Ultimately, the #accountability program is a verifiable process, which is verified to work if you follow it step-by-step. Whether you do that however, is entirely up to you. I can only provide you with the system and the support; the rest is up to you. :family_mmgg:

Please type in `!accountability` into one of the channels to learn more about the accountability program!

We also have a website for our #accountability posting also known as NeverFap Deluxe League.

Healthy Coping Mechanisms
- Meditated for 10 minutes 
- Completed a huge squat + deadlift workout 
- Remained calm throughout the day and really practiced to keep my mind wide and open

To Improve 
- I'm going to focus on becoming more calm throughout the day 
- I want to continue learning not to take things personally, and instead take things one step at a time
