const accountabilityMessage4 = () => new RichEmbed().setTitle("#accountability advice").setDescription(
  `Remember, remaining calm should be your default state 95% of the time, which requires active practice and a conscious effort to retain balance in our lives. This means sticking to a regular routine, going to bed on time etc. :bed:`);
const accountabilityMessage5 = () => new RichEmbed().setTitle("#accountability advice").setDescription(
  `The process is there for a reason. It's there because it works and when you don't stick with the process, you work against it, which means working against yourself. :unamused:`);
const accountabilityMessage6 = () => new RichEmbed().setTitle("#accountability advice").setDescription(
  `Self-criticism doesn't work. When you self-criticise, you essentially give up your power for conscious action by reacting sub-consciously on an emotional level. It's possibly one of the most self-destructive things you can do as a human being in terms of developing control over your emotions. :confused:`);

  `Don't fear your emotions. Embrace those uneasy feelings and learn to be comfortable with them. In other words, learn to be present with these emotions while not reacting to them. It's one of the most powerful things you can learn to do. :love_letter:`);
const accountabilityMessage11 = () => new RichEmbed().setTitle("#accountability advice").setDescription(
  `You absolutely need to develop a list of healthy coping mechanisms for you to practice each day. It's no different to having a list of exercises we do at the gym. It will help you remain consistent. :page_with_curl:`);

const accountabilityMessage14 = () => new RichEmbed().setTitle("#accountability advice").setDescription(

const accountabilityMessage15 = () => new RichEmbed().setTitle("#accountability advice").setDescription(
  `If your mind isn't absolutely calm now, there's no chance you'll be able to make it calm when you're having a craving. Practice now while it's easy, so you can prepare while it's hard. :mountain_bicyclist:`);
const accountabilityMessage16 = () => new RichEmbed().setTitle("#accountability advice").setDescription(
  `You can't cheat your mind by skipping out on meditation, expecting that it won't know. It knows and it always responds appropriately, whether it be in the form of an emotional breakdown or an intense urge to watch porn. Respect your mind and it will respect you back. :ok_hand:`);
