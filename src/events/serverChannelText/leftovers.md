***BASICS***

**The entire process takes around 90 days.**
It takes approximately 90 days to overcome porn addiction. You will only succeed if you commit to the program every single day for the next 90 days. Otherwise, you will not develop the Healthy Coping Mechanisms in order to develop control over your mind.

**You must post in #accountability every single day.**
This will prove your commitment to your porn addiction recovery, and it is an excellent way to keep on-top of your progress, and therefore develop your capacity for awareness.

**95% of your time should be spent remaining calm.**
Calmness should be your default state of mind. It's what makes you powerful and act with intention. You can only be in-control of your thoughts, feelings and emotions when you are calm. However, you will only learn to become calm if you practice it throughout your day.

**The other 5% of your time should be spent practicing Healthy Coping Mechanisms.**
This equates to around 40 minutes per day. Healthy Coping Mechanisms are designed to help you build your capacity for awareness, and is what will allow you to remain calm.

**Your Healthy Coping Mechanism list must include daily meditation.**
Meditation is the most powerful Healthy Coping Mechanism in allowing you to regain control over your emotions. It is a hard expectation that you begin your journey with a daily routine of meditation. Otherwise, you will fail.

**We have strict formatting for #accountability posts.**

***ACCOUNTABILITY FAQ***

**I've relapsed, how do I reset my counter?**

This a question I get a lot. 

Essentially, it can help to understand that this counter has nothing to do with your PMO streak. In fact, we don't allow people to post their PMO Streaks, because it's simply ineffective and therefore an unhealthy coping mechanism.

Put simply, what we are tracking is your commitment to the process. It doesn't matter that you relapsed. What matters is the Healthy Coping Mechanisms that you practiced for that day, and that is essentially what we're focusing on.
