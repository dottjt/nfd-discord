# NeverFap Deluxe Discord Server / GraphQL Server

This NeverFap Deluxe Discord Server is a Node.js Discord API which serves all the logic for the NeverFap Deluxe Bot in our lovely Discord Server. 
Since all the Discord database data is attached to it, the server also hosts the GraphQL API for The NeverFap Deluxe League, which is the conceptual front-end of the server. 

The bot does a heap of different things, but largely it's designed to track your #accountability posting.
